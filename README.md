* a technique for synthesizing speech by replacing the formants (main bands of energy) with pure tone whistles

* your brain, in order to finish constructing the mental content you (unconsciously) expect to experience, is pulling from memory the building materials your environment is failing to provide.

The recording has been stripped of much of the acoustic information that makes human voices perceptually intelligible to us—in other words, that gives our brains something to turn into an experience of meaningful human speech. Next, you’ll hear the original, unaltered recording. Finally, you’ll again hear the stripped—i.e., sine-wave speech—version, but this time your memory is stocked so that it can fill in the gaps.

* The reality is that you are perceiving things that are not there
